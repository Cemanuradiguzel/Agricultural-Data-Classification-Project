# 🌾 Agricultural Data Classification Project  

This project was developed as part of the **Data Mining** course in collaboration with my teammate. We designed a classification framework for an agricultural dataset, focusing on **data cleaning, preprocessing, feature selection**, and evaluating multiple **machine learning algorithms** such as **Random Forest** and **SVM**.  

Key performance metrics, including **accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC**, were analyzed, achieving over **80% accuracy** with optimized models. The results were visualized using **ROC curves** and **confusion matrices**.  

## 🛠️ How We Built It 
1. The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to remove inconsistencies.  
2. Feature selection was applied to enhance model performance.  
3. Machine learning models were trained and evaluated using different metrics.  
4. Results were visualized using **ROC curves** and **confusion matrices**.
