# Agricultural-Data-Classification-Project
Developed a classification framework for an agricultural dataset as part of the Data Mining course 
in collaboration with a teammate. The project involved cleaning and preprocessing data, applying 
feature selection, and evaluating multiple machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and SVM.

Key performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC, were analyzed, achieving 
over 80% accuracy with optimized models. The results were visualized using ROC curves and confusion 
matrices.
