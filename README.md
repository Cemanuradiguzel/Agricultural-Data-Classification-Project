# Agricultural-Data-Classification-Projectt
Developed a classification framework for an agricultural dataset as part of the Data Mining course.
The project involved cleaning and preprocessing data, applying feature selection, and evaluating
multiple machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest and SVM. Key metrics like accuracy,
precision, recall, and AUC were analyzed, achieving over 80% accuracy with optimized models. The
results were visualized using ROC curves and confusion matrices.
